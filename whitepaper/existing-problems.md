## Privacy Theft
The freelance marketplace is looked with another real test in regards to wholesale fraud. Procuring individuals on the freelance platforms opens
the members to the danger of data fraud particularly if their private client data is available. Freelancers remain at a more serious danger of
data fraud than alternate members in this game plan. For example, a dubious individual may take John's personality data. John is a qualified
bookkeeper with a mind blowing rating on the freelance platform. The vindictive individual at that point proceeds to ask for work charging $100
every hour. While the dubious individual may profit by this move, the trustworthiness of the individual whose personality is in effect wrongly
utilized could be traded off.

## Delayed Payout
Another issue looked in the freelance marketplace directly is the security of the assets of the freelancers on the platform. This can be cured by the 
utilization of dedicated escrow wallet and speedy payment processing of Waves blockchain on which Auctionlance is built. Freelancersâ€™ funds
are safe and secured on Ledger Nano hardware wallet with an almost hack impossibility. Another issue looked in this market is especially dear to
the freelancers themselves, and that respects expenses charged per work. Freelancers lose a decent level of their profit to the freelance
platform. These platforms are in fact existing organizations, every freelancer is aware of. Most platforms hold payment for days and weeks
before a freelancer is allowed to withdraw their own funds.

## Dispute settlement:
The subjectivity of work on a freelancing platform often calls for discrepancies in opinions and settlements in disputes. A typical
freelancing platform does not guarantee such settlements. The dispute settlements often involve surplus arbitration costs and unfavorable
binding decisions, which may not be in the best interest of a freelancer or client.
