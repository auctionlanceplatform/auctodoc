## SOLVING THE PROBLEMS 

###### Secured escrow
Funds are stored on hardware wallet which is almost impossible to hack. Both the client and freelancer have their funds and efforts secured
respectively. We ensure no one cheats or blackmails the other by holding funds till agreed milestones are reached.

###### Fair Dispute Settlements
A regular freelancing platform does not ensure such settlements. The debate settlements regularly include surplus mediation costs and
negative restricting choices, which may not be to the greatest advantage of a consultant. We implement the power of the AuctoNode
community consensus to settle disputes without bias.

###### Built-in Messaging system
A social and messaging feature on platform will allow clients to connect and clearly discuss with freelancers what they want.

###### Transparent Pricing
Our system uses a transparent and dedicated escrow wallet to manage pricing. Wallet is open and available for the entire public to look up. This
enables us eliminate internal fraudulent transactions or billing.

###### Reduced transaction charge
We charge clients and freelancers 3% of total service cost. No hidden fees, no withdrawal fees!

###### Blockchain secured transactions
Transactions can easily be traced using the Waves explorer tool. This secures the system from misleading fraudulent rating and reviews.

## OUR CORE SOLUTION MECHANISM
